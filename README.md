# this project

This project was conceived with the ambitious goal of introducing two budding developers, myself and my good friend "Banjo", to the world of DevOps. As we embark on our journey to master this fascinating field, we have decided to build a captivating game that showcases our acquired skills.

	We are currently in the initial stages of our project, it is important to note that we haven't yet delved into the implementation of DevOps practices. We're currently in Phase 1, which primarily focuses on researching and understanding the fundamentals of DevOps as well as make the basis for our game. Once we've completed this phase, we will begin to apply these practices in our workflow, leading to a smoother software development and deployment process. Our primary focus, for now, is to learn and internalize the principles and concepts of DevOps, which will serve as a strong foundation for the subsequent phases of the project.


    
#### Phase One: Foundational Development

1. **2D Rendering in CLI (Command Line Interface):** During this phase, we will implement 2D graphics in the command-line interface for the game. This will allow users to interact with the game without the need for an advanced graphical user interface.
       status: DONE!
        

2. **Basic Combat:** In order to provide a core gameplay experience, we will incorporate basic combat mechanics. Players will be able to attack and defend against other players or enemies.
        status: DONE needs to be implemented.

   
3. **LLM Character Generation:** The integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) will enable the creation of unique characters for each player. This will help generate customized backstories and dialogue based on user input, enhancing the immersion experience.
        status: DONE needs to be implemented.

   
5. **Single Treasure Hunting Quest:** To provide an initial gameplay objective, we will create a single quest revolving around treasure hunting. Players will have to navigate through various dungeons or areas, solve puzzles, and overcome obstacles to reach the treasure. This will also introduce players to the game's storyline and encourage them to continue exploring the world.

These features will create a gaming experience in the initial phase of the project.


#### Phase Two: DevOps Implementation and Technical Debt Reduction

In this phase, we will start implementing DevOps practices to enhance our development workflow. This includes:

1. Consistent Code Formatting: Ensuring the codebase follows a consistent formatting style to improve readability and maintainability of the code.

2. Ample Code Comments: Adding meaningful comments to help other developers understand the purpose, intent, and logic behind the code.

3. Reducing Technical Debt: This is done by refactoring or rewriting parts of the codebase that we find to be poorly written, inefficient, or difficult to understand. This will help improve the overall health and stability of the system.

4. MORE COMING

As a result, our development process will become more efficient, and our codebase will be more maintainable and scalable. This will further prepare us for the next stages of the project.
